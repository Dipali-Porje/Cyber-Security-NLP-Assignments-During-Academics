## 🔐 Cyber Security Practicals

### 1. **Implementation of S-DES**
> Implement the Simplified Data Encryption Standard (S-DES) algorithm for encryption and decryption.

### 2. **Implementation of S-AES**
> Implement the Simplified Advanced Encryption Standard (S-AES) algorithm.

### 3. **Implementation of Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**
> Simulate secure key exchange using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.

### 4. **Implementation of RSA**
> Implement the RSA algorithm for secure encryption and decryption of messages.

### 5. **Implementation of ECC Algorithm**
> Implement the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm for encryption.

### 6. **Enable/Configure (Windows/Ubuntu) Firewall**
> Create rules to filter network traffic and block unauthorized access using system firewall settings.

### 7. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**
> Configure and demonstrate an IDS to detect suspicious activities and generate alerts.

## 🧪 Cyber Security Mini Projects 

### 11. **Mini Project 4: Insecure vs. Secured Website**
> Create an insecure website using HTTP and demonstrate how attackers can manipulate its content. Add a payment gateway simulation and secure it later using HTTPS + SSL.

## 💬 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Practicals

### 1. **Survey of Recent Advances in NLP**
> A detailed survey on the current developments in NLP techniques, tools, and applications.

### 2. **Text Preprocessing Tasks**
> Implement NLP preprocessing steps such as:
- Tokenization  
- Stemming  
- Lemmatization  
- Stop word removal  
- Using inbuilt NLP libraries and regex

### 3. **Spelling Correction using Edit Distance**
> Apply the minimum edit distance algorithm to correct spelling errors in words.

### 4. **Toxic Comment Classification**
> Implement a classification system to detect different types of toxic comments (threats, insults, obscenity, etc.)  
📚 **Dataset**: [Jigsaw Toxic Comment Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data)

### 5. **Voice-based Recommendation System**
> Build a recommendation system using a voice-enabled chatbot.  
🛠️ Use: **Google Speech Engine**
